# melody-practice

Mostly just playing around with Clojure's Overtone. Unfortunately, this particular project is on hold at
the moment. Also, my apologies that the best documentation as to what's going on is in the .odt (at least
I'm fairly explicit about what's happening there...).

## Usage

If you wanna check it out, then cool. It's whatever. This is mainly for reference, so you're welcome to 
take snippets of code if you want, feel free.
